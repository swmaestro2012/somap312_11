\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em A class for listing files and directories to check. This class creates a list of files to check. If directory name is given then all files in the directory matching the filter will be added. The directory can be also added recursively when all files in subdirectories are added too. The filenames are matched against the filter and only those files whose filename extension is included in the filter list are added. \end{DoxyCompactList}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
